		<p>
			I was born and raised in Colorado Springs, Colorado and attended Colorado State University ('13') and graduated with a dual Bachelor's in English and Spanish.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have spent the past four years expanding my knowledge of the globe with traveling. I have developed a personal tradition of taking a trip abroad every year to somewhere I have never been. As of now, Chile and France are tied for my favorite.
		</p>
		<p>
			Like most Coloradoans, I enjoy the outdoors (weather permitting). Who doesn't love a hike through the beautiful mountains or sipping on a cold beer on the patio? It's also of no surprise that I love practicing yoga also!
		</p>
		<p>
			I have a diverse set of interests- there are few things I don't like or won't try. My top interests include science, learning, conservation and animals. I would love to find a creative way to combine my developing knowledge of technology to improve land and animal conservation efforts.
